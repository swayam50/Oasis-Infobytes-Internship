                        John Ronald Reuel Tolkien (1892–1973) was a major
                        scholar of the English language, specialising in Old and
                        Middle English. Twice Professor of Anglo-Saxon (Old
                        English) at the University of Oxford, he also wrote a
                        number of stories, including most famously The Hobbit
                        (1937) and The Lord of the Rings (1954–1955), which are
                        set in a pre-historic era in an invented version of our
                        world which he called by the Middle English name of
                        Middle-earth. This was peopled by Men (and women),
                        Elves, Dwarves, Trolls, Orcs (or Goblins) and of course
                        Hobbits. He has regularly been condemned by the Eng.
                        Lit. establishment, with honourable exceptions, but
                        loved by literally millions of readers worldwide.
                        <br /><br />
                        Meanwhile Tolkien continued developing his mythology and
                        languages. As mentioned above, he told his children
                        stories, some of which he developed into those published
                        posthumously as Mr. Bliss, Roverandom, etc. However,
                        according to his own account, one day when he was
                        engaged in the soul-destroying task of marking
                        examination papers, he discovered that one candidate had
                        left one page of an answer-book blank. On this page,
                        moved by who knows what anarchic daemon, he wrote “In a
                        hole in the ground there lived a hobbit“.

                        J. R. R. Tolkien's fantasy books on Middle-earth,
                        especially The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion,
                        drew on a wide array of influences including language,
                        Christianity, mythology, archaeology, ancient and modern
                        literature, and personal experience. He was inspired
                        primarily by his profession, philology; his work centred
                        on the study of Old English literature, especially
                        Beowulf, and he acknowledged its importance to his
                        writings. <br /><br />
                        He was a gifted linguist, influenced by Germanic,
                        Celtic, Finnish, Slavic, and Greek language and
                        mythology. His fiction reflected his Christian beliefs
                        and his early reading of adventure stories and fantasy
                        books. Commentators have attempted to identify many
                        literary and topological antecedents for characters,
                        places and events in Tolkien's writings. Some writers
                        were certainly important to him, including the Arts and
                        Crafts polymath William Morris, and he undoubtedly made
                        use of some real place-names, such as Bag End, the name
                        of his aunt's home.
                        <br /><br />
                        Tolkien stated that he had been influenced by his
                        childhood experiences of the English countryside of
                        Worcestershire and its urbanisation by the growth of
                        Birmingham, and his personal experience of fighting in
                        the trenches of the First World War.

                    J.R.R. Tolkien combined his academic training in languages
                    and his love of storytelling to create Middle-earth, a
                    fictional continent populated by wizards, elves, orcs,
                    dragons, hobbits, talking trees and other mythical
                    creatures. Below, some of the sketches and paintings that
                    show Middle-earth (and beyond!) as Tolkien himself
                    envisioned it.

                    Tolkien studied Old and Middle English, along with the
                    "ancient languages of Britain." His extensive study of
                    ancient languages and literature comes out in his choice of
                    character names, in the riddles and songs that appear
                    throughout his texts, and also in his choice of settings, as
                    he was "reconstructing" a world from words.
